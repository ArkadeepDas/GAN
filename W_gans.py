# W-gan provides better training stability 
# Loss of W-gan means something 
# Some termination criteria is there
# It's very different from the previous GANs we seen
# In previous DCGAN the problem is called "Mode Collapse". When model collapsed only output spacific classes.

##########################################################################################
# We want the genarated images and real images distribution to be very similar in order to
# generate realistic looking images
##########################################################################################

# DCGAN Loss was similar to JS divargence which leads to unstable training
# W-gan we use Wasserstein distance
# They don't use sigmoid activation function at the end of the discriminator which does not limit output to be between 0 and 1
# In this loss discriminator try to maximize the distance as much as possible but generator wants to minimize the distance
# Loss function is bit different from previous
# Activation function used here is RMSProp

# It takes longer training time
# Here we use exact same model as DCGAN
