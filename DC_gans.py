# Let's Implement DC GANs(Deep Convolution GANs)
# In paper it's generator takes a noise of 100 dimentional vector
# Apply Transpose operation of Convolution Neural Network for Upscale
# 4x4x1024 -> 8x8x512 -> 16x16x256 -> 32x32x128 -> 64x64x3

# Diccriminator network is also the same but opposite direction
# GANs are very sensitive in parameters
# Here no polling layers are used, only convolution layers are used
# In Generator ReLU is used in all layers except the output layers, which uses Tanh.
# In Discriminator LeakyRelu activation is used in all layers

# They use mini-batch stochastic gradient descent(SGD) with a mini-batch 128.
